The structure that best describes the collection of urine in the body is the **Kidney**.

### Explanation

The kidney is a vital organ responsible for filtering blood and producing urine. Within the kidney, the renal pelvis acts as a funnel-shaped structure that collects urine from the calyces before it moves to the ureter and eventually to the bladder [Data: Entities (722, 711)]. The kidney's role in urine collection is crucial as it initiates the process of urine formation and drainage.

### Other Structures

- **Bladder**: The bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine received from the ureters before it is excreted through urination. It does not collect urine directly from the blood but rather serves as a storage site [Data: Entities (125, 3927)].

- **Ureter**: The ureter is a tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. It is involved in the transportation of urine but not in its initial collection [Data: Entities (535, 1024)].

- **Urethra**: The urethra is a duct that serves as a conduit for urine to be expelled from the body. It is the terminal part of the urinary tract and does not play a role in urine collection [Data: Entities (361)].

In summary, the kidney is the primary structure responsible for collecting urine in the body, making option B the correct choice.
