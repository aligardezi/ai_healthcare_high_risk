The human body has several defense mechanisms to protect against environmental bacteria, and among the options provided, **B. Mucous membranes** best describes a primary defense mechanism.

### Mucous Membranes

Mucous membranes line various cavities in the body and cover the surface of internal organs. They are a crucial part of the body's defense system, acting as a barrier to pathogens, including bacteria. These membranes secrete mucus, a thick fluid that traps bacteria and other particles, preventing them from entering the body and causing infections. The nasal mucosa, for example, is a type of mucous membrane that lines the nasal cavity and plays a significant role in filtering and trapping airborne pathogens [Data: Entities (2349, 223)].

### Other Options

- **A. Hair in the nose**: While nasal hair does play a role in trapping larger particles and preventing them from entering the respiratory system, it is not as comprehensive a defense mechanism against bacteria as mucous membranes.

- **C. Osteoblasts**: These are cells responsible for bone formation and do not play a direct role in defending against bacteria.

- **D. Saliva**: Saliva does have antibacterial properties and helps in the initial processing of food, but its primary role is not as a defense mechanism against environmental bacteria. It contains enzymes like lysozyme that can break down bacterial cell walls, providing some level of protection [Data: Entities (1420)].

In summary, mucous membranes are a critical component of the body's defense against environmental bacteria, providing a physical barrier and trapping pathogens before they can enter the body.
