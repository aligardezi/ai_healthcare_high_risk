Gastrulation is a fundamental process in early embryonic development that leads to the formation of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This process is crucial as it sets the stage for the subsequent development of tissues and organs in the embryo.

### Timing of Gastrulation

Gastrulation occurs before neurulation. Neurulation is the process that follows gastrulation and involves the formation of the neural tube from the neural plate, which eventually develops into the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord [Data: Entities (4668, 4669, 824, 4670, 4671); Relationships (5883, 5884, 10439, 10440)].

### Formation of Germ Layers

During gastrulation, the mesoderm is formed along with the other two germ layers. The mesoderm is the middle layer that gives rise to various structures, including muscles, bones, and the circulatory system. The ectoderm forms the outer layer, which will develop into the skin and nervous system, while the endoderm forms the inner layer, leading to the development of the gut and associated structures.

### Conclusion

Based on the information about the timing and processes involved in embryonic development, the correct answer is:

**C. mesoderm formation and occurs before neurulation.**

This choice accurately reflects the sequence and processes involved in early embryonic development.
