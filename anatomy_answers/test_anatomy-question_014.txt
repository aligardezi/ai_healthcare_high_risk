I don't have specific information on the growth of the mandible from the data provided. However, I can provide some general insights based on anatomical knowledge.

### General Insights on Mandibular Growth

1. **Mental Symphysis Closure**: The mental symphysis, which is the line of fusion between the two halves of the mandible, typically closes within the first year of life. This is consistent with statement A.

2. **Condylar Growth Cartilage**: The condylar growth cartilage of the mandible is responsible for the growth of the mandible in length. It continues to be active until the end of puberty, which is generally around the late teenage years. Therefore, statement B might not be entirely accurate if it suggests cessation at the onset of puberty.

3. **Ossification Centre**: The mandible begins to ossify around the 6th to 8th week of intrauterine life (I.U.L), and this process occurs medial to Meckel's cartilage. This aligns with statement C.

4. **Functional Matrix and Muscles**: The lateral pterygoid muscle is primarily involved in the protraction and lateral movement of the mandible, not directly influencing the angle of the mandible. The angle of the mandible is more influenced by the masseter and medial pterygoid muscles, which are involved in elevation and stabilization. Thus, statement D may not be correct in the context of the functional matrix acting on the angle of the mandible.

Based on these insights, statement C appears to be the most accurate regarding the growth of the mandible.
