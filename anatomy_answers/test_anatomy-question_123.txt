The correct answer is **B. The temporal bone**.

### Explanation

The zygomatic arch is a bony structure on the side of the skull that is formed by the union of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone. The temporal bone is a complex structure located at the sides and base of the skull, and it plays a crucial role in the anatomy of the cranium. It is involved in forming the cranial cavity and houses the structures of the ear [Data: Entities (46); Relationships (81)].

The zygomatic process of the temporal bone is specifically the part that contributes to the formation of the zygomatic arch. This process articulates with the zygomatic bone, which is also known as the cheekbone, to form the arch that is prominent in the cheek area [Data: Entities (2830, 3628); Relationships (81, 6768)].

### Additional Information

- **Maxillary Bone**: The maxilla, or maxillary bone, is primarily involved in forming the upper jaw and parts of the orbit and nasal cavity. It does not directly contribute to the formation of the zygomatic arch [Data: Entities (16); Relationships (160, 164)].

- **Sphenoid Bone**: The sphenoid bone is a complex bone located at the base of the skull, contributing to the structure of the cranial cavity and the orbits, but it does not form part of the zygomatic arch [Data: Entities (12)].

- **Frontal Bone**: The frontal bone forms the forehead and part of the eye sockets but does not participate in forming the zygomatic arch [Data: Entities (90); Relationships (940, 944)].

Thus, the temporal bone is the correct choice as it directly contributes to the formation of the zygomatic arch through its zygomatic process.
