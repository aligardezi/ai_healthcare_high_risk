In the context of severe blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen, the organ most likely to be involved is the **spleen**.

### Anatomical Location

The spleen is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, which is the area specified in the scenario [Data: Entities (721, 3955); Relationships (5494); Sources (1712)]. This quadrant is known to house the spleen and the stomach, making the spleen a prime candidate for injury in cases of trauma to this region.

### Vulnerability to Trauma

The spleen is particularly susceptible to injury from blunt abdominal trauma due to its position and relatively fragile structure. It is an organ that plays a crucial role in filtering blood and is involved in the immune system, but its location under the left dome of the diaphragm makes it vulnerable to impact injuries [Data: Entities (721); Relationships (3783)].

### Comparison with Other Organs

- **Appendix**: The appendix is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, making it unlikely to be involved in trauma to the left upper abdomen [Data: Entities (1500, 3956); Relationships (7881)].
  
- **Gallbladder**: The gallbladder is situated in the right upper quadrant, closely associated with the liver, and is not typically affected by trauma to the left upper abdomen [Data: Entities (718, 1649); Relationships (5418)].
  
- **Urinary Bladder**: The urinary bladder is located in the pelvis, and while it can be involved in lower abdominal trauma, it is not typically affected by injuries to the left upper quadrant [Data: Entities (3927)].

### Conclusion

Given the anatomical location and the nature of the injury described, the spleen is the organ most likely to be involved in severe blunt trauma to the left upper abdomen. This aligns with common clinical findings where splenic injuries are a frequent consequence of such trauma.
