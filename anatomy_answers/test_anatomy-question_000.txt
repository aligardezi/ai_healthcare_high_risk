### Understanding the Facial Nerve and Its Functions

The facial nerve, also known as cranial nerve VII, is a complex nerve responsible for various functions, including motor control of facial muscles, taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and parasympathetic innervation to several glands [Data: Entities (346, 331, 4912)]. It travels through the temporal bone and exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen [Data: Relationships (3236, 384)].

### Effects of a Lesion at the Stylomastoid Foramen

A lesion at the stylomastoid foramen primarily affects the motor functions of the facial nerve. This is because the facial nerve gives off its motor branches to the muscles of facial expression after exiting the stylomastoid foramen. Therefore, a lesion at this location would result in ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles, leading to an inability to perform facial expressions on the affected side [Data: Sources (349); Relationships (3250)].

### Additional Considerations

The loss of taste and lacrimation would not typically occur with a lesion at the stylomastoid foramen. The chorda tympani, which carries taste fibers from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and the greater petrosal nerve, which carries parasympathetic fibers for lacrimation, branch off the facial nerve before it exits the stylomastoid foramen [Data: Sources (1281, 2459); Relationships (3237, 3238)]. Therefore, these functions are usually preserved unless the lesion is located more proximally, affecting these branches.

### Conclusion

Given the location of the lesion at the stylomastoid foramen, the correct answer is:

**A. paralysis of the facial muscles.**

This option accurately reflects the primary consequence of a lesion at this site, without involving the loss of taste or lacrimation, which would require a more proximal lesion affecting the respective branches of the facial nerve.
