The elevation of the palatine shelves during embryonic development is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. 

### Descent of the Tongue

The descent of the tongue plays a crucial role in palatine shelf elevation. During development, the tongue initially occupies a position between the palatine shelves. As the tongue descends, it allows the shelves to move into a horizontal position, facilitating their elevation and eventual fusion to form the hard palate.

### Changes in Flexure of the Developing Brain

The developing brain undergoes significant changes in shape and size, which can indirectly influence the positioning and movement of surrounding structures, including the palatine shelves. These changes can contribute to the spatial dynamics necessary for the shelves to elevate and fuse.

### Hydrophilic Molecules and Turgor Pressure

Hydrophilic molecules within the palatine shelves can increase turgor pressure, which is the pressure of the cell contents against the cell wall. This pressure can cause the shelves to swell and elevate, contributing to their movement into the correct position for fusion.

### Combination of Processes

In reality, the elevation of the palatine shelves is likely due to a combination of these processes. Each factor plays a role in ensuring the proper positioning and fusion of the shelves, which is critical for the formation of the hard palate. Therefore, option D, a combination of these three processes, is the most comprehensive explanation for palatine shelf elevation. 

This multifactorial approach highlights the complexity of embryonic development, where multiple biological mechanisms work in concert to achieve the intricate structures of the human body.
