### Blood Cells and Their Nuclei

In the human body, blood cells are categorized into different types based on their functions and characteristics. One of the distinguishing features of these cells is the presence or absence of a nucleus. Understanding which blood cells have a nucleus is crucial for comprehending their roles in the body.

### Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells)

Erythrocytes, commonly known as red blood cells, are unique among blood cells because they do not have a nucleus. During their development in the bone marrow, erythrocytes lose their nucleus to maximize space for hemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport. This adaptation allows erythrocytes to efficiently carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body and return carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs for exhalation [Data: Entities (4499); Relationships (10385)].

### Other Blood Cells

- **Lymphocytes**: These are a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response. They have a large, round nucleus and are crucial for the body's defense against pathogens [Data: Entities (3070); Relationships (4941)].
  
- **Monocytes**: These are another type of white blood cell that have a single, large nucleus. They play a role in phagocytosis, where they engulf and digest cellular debris and pathogens.
  
- **Basophils**: These are a type of granulocyte, a category of white blood cells, and they contain a nucleus. Basophils are involved in inflammatory responses and allergic reactions.

### Conclusion

Among the options provided, the correct answer is **C. Erythrocyte**. Erythrocytes are the only blood cells listed that do not have a nucleus, allowing them to efficiently perform their role in oxygen transport.
