The lymphoid organ that serves as a reservoir for red blood cells and filters organisms from the blood is the **D. Spleen**.

### Spleen

The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. It plays a crucial role in the body's immune system and blood filtration processes. The spleen is responsible for filtering blood, producing and removing blood cells, and forming part of the immune system. It acts as a reservoir for red blood cells and helps in the removal of old or damaged red blood cells from circulation. Additionally, the spleen filters pathogens and other organisms from the blood, contributing to the body's defense mechanisms [Data: Entities (721)].

### Other Options

- **Appendix**: The appendix is a small, tube-like organ attached to the cecum, part of the large intestine. It is not primarily involved in blood filtration or serving as a reservoir for red blood cells. Its function is more related to the immune system, particularly in young individuals, but it is not a major lymphoid organ like the spleen [Data: Entities (1500)].

- **Gallbladder**: The gallbladder is a small organ located on the visceral surface of the liver. Its primary function is to store and concentrate bile produced by the liver, which aids in digestion. It is not involved in blood filtration or serving as a reservoir for red blood cells [Data: Entities (718)].

- **Pancreas**: The pancreas is a glandular organ involved in both the digestive and endocrine systems. It produces digestive enzymes and hormones such as insulin but does not function as a lymphoid organ or a reservoir for red blood cells [Data: Entities (720)].

In summary, the spleen is the correct answer as it is the lymphoid organ that functions as a reservoir for red blood cells and filters organisms from the blood.
