Proprioceptive nerve endings are specialized sensory receptors that provide information about joint position and movement, playing a crucial role in proprioception. In synovial joints, these nerve endings are primarily located in the joint capsule and ligaments. 

### Explanation

**Joint Capsule and Ligaments**: The joint capsule is a fibrous structure that surrounds synovial joints, providing stability and protection. It is lined by the synovial membrane and contains synovial fluid, which facilitates smooth joint movement. Ligaments, on the other hand, are fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones, providing additional stability and support to the joints. Both the joint capsule and ligaments are richly innervated with proprioceptive nerve endings, which help in detecting changes in joint position and movement [Data: Entities (817, 723); Relationships (5842, 5764)].

**Other Structures**: While the synovial membrane plays a crucial role in joint lubrication and health, it is not primarily associated with proprioceptive nerve endings. Similarly, articular cartilage and articular discs, although important for cushioning and stability, are not the main sites for proprioceptive nerve endings.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C. capsule and ligaments**.
