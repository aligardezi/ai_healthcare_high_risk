The disorder characterized by uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the day is **D. Narcolepsy**.

### Explanation

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects the brain's ability to control sleep-wake cycles. People with narcolepsy may experience excessive daytime sleepiness and sudden episodes of falling asleep during the day, often at inappropriate times and places. These episodes can occur with little warning and can be quite disruptive to daily life.

### Other Options

- **A. Dyslexia**: This is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. It is not related to sleep.

- **B. Epilepsy**: This is a neurological disorder marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. While it involves episodes of abnormal brain activity, it is not characterized by falling asleep during the day.

- **C. Hydrocephalus**: This is a condition involving an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain's ventricles, leading to increased pressure. It is not directly related to sleep episodes.

Narcolepsy is distinct from these other conditions due to its specific impact on sleep regulation.
