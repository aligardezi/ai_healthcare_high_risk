During the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, food is prevented from entering the larynx primarily by the action of the epiglottis. The correct answer is:

**B. upward movement of the epiglottis.**

### Mechanism of Swallowing

The process of swallowing involves several coordinated actions to ensure that food and liquid are directed towards the esophagus and not the respiratory tract. During the pharyngeal phase, the epiglottis plays a crucial role by moving downward to cover the laryngeal inlet. This action effectively prevents food and liquid from entering the trachea and directs them towards the esophagus [Data: Entities (969); Relationships (4467, 4495, 6490)].

### Role of the Epiglottis

The epiglottis is a leaf-shaped flap of cartilage located at the top of the larynx. Its primary function during swallowing is to act as a valve that closes the laryngeal inlet, thereby protecting the airway from aspiration of food and liquid. This movement is essential for safe swallowing and is a key component of the body's protective mechanisms during the ingestion of food [Data: Entities (969); Relationships (4467, 4495, 6490)].

### Other Options

- **A. Constriction of the laryngeal entrance:** While the laryngeal entrance does narrow, the primary mechanism preventing food entry is the epiglottis covering the laryngeal inlet.
- **C. Downward movement of the larynx:** The larynx actually moves upward and forward during swallowing to facilitate the closure of the epiglottis over the laryngeal inlet.
- **D. Increase in respiratory rate:** This is not related to the prevention of food entering the larynx during swallowing. In fact, breathing is temporarily paused during swallowing to prevent aspiration.

In summary, the upward movement of the epiglottis to cover the laryngeal inlet is the primary mechanism by which food is prevented from entering the larynx during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing.
