SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
In the spinal cord, motor neuron cell bodies are primarily located in Lamina IX. The spinal cord's gray matter is organized into ten distinct layers known as Rexed's laminae, each with specific functions and types of neurons. Lamina IX is particularly significant because it contains the cell bodies of lower motor neurons, which are responsible for innervating skeletal muscles and facilitating voluntary movement.

### Explanation of Laminae

- **Lamina I and V**: These laminae are part of the posterior horn of the spinal cord and are involved in processing sensory information. Lamina I, for instance, is associated with the transmission of pain and temperature sensations [Data: Entities (4532); Sources (2042)].

- **Lamina II**: Known as the substantia gelatinosa, this lamina is involved in modulating pain and temperature sensations. It does not contain motor neuron cell bodies but is crucial for sensory processing.

- **Lamina IX**: This lamina is located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord and is where the cell bodies of lower motor neurons are found. These neurons play a critical role in motor control by transmitting signals from the central nervous system to muscles, enabling movement [Data: Entities (4569, 2217); Sources (2041, 2134)].

### Conclusion

Given the options provided, the correct answer is **D. Lamina IX**, as it is the lamina associated with the location of motor neuron cell bodies in the spinal cord.
