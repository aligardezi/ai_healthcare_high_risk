SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
Saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase, which primarily acts upon starches. Salivary amylase, also known as ptyalin, begins the process of breaking down starches into simpler sugars in the mouth, which is the initial step in the digestion of carbohydrates. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the efficient digestion and absorption of carbohydrates as the food progresses through the digestive system.

### Salivary Amylase and Starch Digestion

Salivary amylase is secreted by the salivary glands, including the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands, into the oral cavity. As food is chewed, it mixes with saliva, allowing the enzyme to act on the starches present in the food. This process not only aids in digestion but also enhances the taste and texture of the food, making it easier to swallow.

### Other Nutrients

- **Proteins**: The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach, where they are broken down by the enzyme pepsin.
- **Fats**: The digestion of fats primarily occurs in the small intestine with the help of bile and pancreatic lipase.
- **Minerals**: Minerals do not require enzymatic digestion; they are absorbed directly in the intestines.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A. Starches**. Salivary amylase specifically targets starches, initiating their breakdown into maltose and dextrins, which are further digested in the small intestine.
