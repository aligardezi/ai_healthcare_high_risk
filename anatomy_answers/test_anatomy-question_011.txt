SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
In the scenario described, the patient has suffered damage to the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve. This nerve is responsible for innervating several muscles that control eye movement, as well as the sphincter pupillae muscle, which is involved in pupillary constriction. Damage to the oculomotor nerve can lead to a condition known as third nerve palsy.

### Effects of Third Cranial Nerve Damage

1. **Pupillary Effects**: The oculomotor nerve carries parasympathetic fibers that innervate the sphincter pupillae muscle, which is responsible for constricting the pupil. Damage to this nerve results in the loss of parasympathetic input, leading to unopposed sympathetic activity. Consequently, this causes pupillary dilation (mydriasis) [Data: Entities (1001, 3417); Relationships (9937)].

2. **Eye Movement**: The oculomotor nerve innervates most of the extraocular muscles, including the medial rectus, which is responsible for moving the eye medially. Damage to the oculomotor nerve results in the inability to move the eye medially, leading to a lateral strabismus (exotropia), where the eye deviates outward due to the unopposed action of the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducent nerve (cranial nerve VI) [Data: Entities (518, 3205, 2138); Relationships (4382, 8317, 8312)].

### Conclusion

Given the effects of third cranial nerve damage, the signs that will be present in the patient are pupillary dilation and a lateral strabismus. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D. Pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus**.
