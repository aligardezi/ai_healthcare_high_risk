The correct sequence that describes the systemic circulation is:

**B. Left ventricle → aorta → arteries → capillaries → veins**

### Explanation

**Systemic Circulation Overview**

Systemic circulation is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body, and returns deoxygenated blood back to the heart. It begins in the left ventricle, which pumps oxygen-rich blood into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. From the aorta, blood travels through a network of arteries, which progressively branch into smaller arterioles and eventually into capillaries. 

**Capillaries and Gas Exchange**

In the capillaries, the exchange of oxygen and nutrients for carbon dioxide and waste products occurs. This is a critical step in systemic circulation, as it allows tissues to receive the oxygen and nutrients they need for metabolism and function.

**Return to the Heart**

After passing through the capillaries, the now deoxygenated blood is collected into venules, which coalesce into larger veins. These veins ultimately return the blood to the right atrium of the heart, completing the systemic circuit. The blood will then enter the pulmonary circulation to be reoxygenated in the lungs.

### Incorrect Options

- **Option A**: This sequence incorrectly places veins before capillaries, which is not the correct order in systemic circulation.
- **Option C and D**: These sequences describe the pulmonary circulation, which involves the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk, and is responsible for oxygenating the blood in the lungs, not systemic circulation.

In summary, systemic circulation is a crucial process that ensures oxygenated blood is distributed throughout the body and deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart for reoxygenation. The correct sequence reflects the flow from the left ventricle through the aorta, arteries, capillaries, and finally veins.
