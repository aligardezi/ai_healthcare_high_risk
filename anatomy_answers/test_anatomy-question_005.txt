### Understanding the Impact of a C6 Spinal Cord Injury on Breathing

When considering the impact of a spinal cord injury at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6), it is crucial to understand the role of the cervical spinal cord in respiratory function. The diaphragm, the primary muscle responsible for breathing, is innervated by the phrenic nerves, which originate from the spinal cord levels C3 to C5 [Data: Entities (1647, 2095, 2918); Relationships (3730, 8045)].

### Analysis of Breathing Capabilities

Given that the phrenic nerves, which are essential for diaphragm function, originate from C3 to C5, an injury at the C6 level typically does not directly impair the diaphragm's ability to function. Therefore, the patient should retain the ability to breathe independently, as the primary motor innervation to the diaphragm remains intact. This suggests that option D, "Breathing will be unaffected," is the most accurate choice regarding the direct impact on the diaphragm.

### Considerations for Other Respiratory Muscles

While the diaphragm is the primary muscle for breathing, other muscles, such as the intercostal muscles, also play a role in respiration, particularly during forced breathing. These muscles receive innervation from thoracic spinal nerves, which are not directly affected by a C6 injury. However, the injury may impact other aspects of respiratory function, such as the ability to cough or clear secretions, due to potential involvement of accessory respiratory muscles.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, while a C6 spinal cord injury does not directly affect the diaphragm's innervation, it may have implications for overall respiratory function, particularly in terms of respiratory efficiency and the ability to perform forceful respiratory maneuvers. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D, "Breathing will be unaffected," in terms of the diaphragm's basic function, but with the understanding that some aspects of respiratory function may still be compromised.
