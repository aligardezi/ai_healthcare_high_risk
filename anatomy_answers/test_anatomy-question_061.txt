### Analysis of Glossopharyngeal Nerve Function

The glossopharyngeal nerve, also known as cranial nerve IX, plays a crucial role in various sensory and motor functions in the head and neck region. It is primarily responsible for carrying taste sensations from the posterior third of the tongue and providing general sensory information from the pharyngeal part of the tongue. Additionally, it provides somatic sensory innervation to the oropharynx and is involved in the gag reflex. The glossopharyngeal nerve also innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle and carries parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland [Data: Entities (1819, 1631); Relationships (6257, 6250, 7992, 7991, 8431)].

### Evaluation of Options

- **Option A: Loss of taste over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.**
  - The anterior two-thirds of the tongue is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) via the chorda tympani, not the glossopharyngeal nerve. Therefore, damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve would not affect taste sensation in this region [Data: Entities (4912, 349); Relationships (3154)].

- **Option B: Loss of somaesthetic sensation over the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.**
  - The lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve (V3), is responsible for general sensory innervation of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. This function is not related to the glossopharyngeal nerve, so damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve would not result in loss of somaesthetic sensation in this area [Data: Entities (887); Relationships (6203, 4201)].

- **Option C: Loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue.**
  - The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for both taste and general sensory innervation of the posterior third of the tongue. Therefore, damage to this nerve would indeed result in the loss of these sensations in the posterior third of the tongue [Data: Entities (1819, 1631); Relationships (4203)].

- **Option D: Paralysis of the muscles of the tongue.**
  - The hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) is responsible for motor control of the tongue muscles, not the glossopharyngeal nerve. Therefore, damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve would not cause paralysis of the tongue muscles [Data: Entities (1108, 1216); Relationships (4202)].

### Conclusion

The correct answer is **C. loss of taste and somaesthetic sensation over the posterior third of the tongue**. Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve would specifically affect the sensory functions related to the posterior third of the tongue, including both taste and general sensation.
