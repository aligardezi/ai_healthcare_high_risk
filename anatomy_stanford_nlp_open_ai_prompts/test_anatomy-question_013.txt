Laryngoscopic examination of the vocal folds after suspected recurrent laryngeal nerve damage usually shows that the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position between adduction and abduction. This is because

A. cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoid muscles are fully active.
B. cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoids are weak.
C. cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are fully active.
D. cricothyroid muscle is paralyzed but the interarytenoids are weak.
