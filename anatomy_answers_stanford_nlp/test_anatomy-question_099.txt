Based on the provided information, the submandibular salivary gland is described as being "hooked around the margin of the mylohyoid muscle" and "is directly impression on the medial side of the mandible inferior to the mylohyoid line." This suggests the gland is located both superficially and deeper around the mandible and mylohyoid muscle.

Given these anatomical details, an enlarged submandibular gland would likely be palpable both intraorally (due to its position relative to the mylohyoid muscle and oral cavity) and extraorally (due to its more superficial position and extension over the mandible).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. to be palpable both intra- and extraorally.
