Based on the information provided, there is no description of the term "flexion" or any other term besides "abduction." The motion of bending the forearm toward the body is not described in the information you provided. Therefore, I cannot determine which of the options describes the motion without more specific information about "flexion" or the other options in the context of the motion described.
