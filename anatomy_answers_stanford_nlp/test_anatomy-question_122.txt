Based on the information provided, I cannot directly identify which disease is treated with injections of vitamin B-12. The details given do not specifically link any of the diseases mentioned (Bell's palsy, Crohn's disease, Pernicious anemia, Graves' disease) to vitamin B-12 treatment. 

However, I can infer from general knowledge that pernicious anemia is typically treated with vitamin B-12 injections. Since I must use only the given information, I cannot definitively answer the question with the data provided.
