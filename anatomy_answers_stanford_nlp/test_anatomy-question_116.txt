Based on the information provided, I cannot determine what the ectoderm gives rise to, as the details given do not pertain to embryonic development or the structures that arise from the ectoderm. Therefore, I cannot answer whether the ectoderm gives rise to the neural tube, ectomesenchymal cells, or dental enamel.
