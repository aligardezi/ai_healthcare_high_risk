Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of the third cranial nerve or its effects related to trauma to the orbit. The details provided relate to various characteristics of something described as "third," and there is no specific link to the effects of cranial nerve damage such as ptosis or other symptoms. Therefore, I cannot determine the correct answer (B. ptosis) using the information given, as it requires knowledge beyond what is provided.
