Based on the information provided, we can deduce the answer without using general knowledge by focusing on specific clues from the question and the options. The patient has a fracture where the radius is bent, not displaced, and the skin is intact.

- "Bent but not displaced" suggests a type of fracture typically found in children due to the flexibility of their bones. This aligns with a "greenstick" fracture.
- "Skin is intact" indicates a "closed" fracture, not an "open" or "compound" fracture.

Therefore, based on the clues given, the correct answer is:

A. Closed, greenstick
