The correct sequence that describes systemic circulation is:

B. Left ventricle → aorta → arteries → capillaries → veins

This sequence accurately represents the flow of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aorta, then through arteries to capillaries for nutrient and gas exchange, and finally returning deoxygenated blood through veins back to the heart.
