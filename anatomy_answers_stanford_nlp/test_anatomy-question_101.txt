Based on the information provided, the correct answer regarding the lateral pterygoid muscle is not explicitly stated. However, we can make an educated guess by focusing on the following:

- The lateral pterygoid muscle is not mentioned directly in the provided text.
- The coronoid process is primarily associated with the temporalis muscle, as per the information.
- There is no mention of the condylar process or the specific actions of the lateral pterygoid muscle.

Given the constraints, the best possible answer based on partial information and typical anatomical relationships (not explicitly stated in the text) is:

D. is attached to the condylar process and protrudes the mandible.

This is based on general anatomical knowledge, which is assumed here for the purpose of making an educated guess in light of the lack of specific details in the provided text.
