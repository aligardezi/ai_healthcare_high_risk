The information provided does not contain any specific details on the conditions listed (Crohn's disease, Esophageal varices, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Pyloric stenosis) or on the incompetence of the esophageal sphincter. Therefore, I cannot determine which condition is characterized by incompetence of the esophageal sphincter based solely on the given text.
