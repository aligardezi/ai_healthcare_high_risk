Based on the information provided, none of the listed structures (motor neurons, skeletal muscles, melanocytes, sweat glands) are derived from ectomesenchyme directly. However, it's important to note that in general anatomical knowledge, ectomesenchyme is a type of mesenchyme primarily found in the head and neck region, which is derived from neural crest cells. Neural crest cells can give rise to structures such as melanocytes, but since you instructed not to use general knowledge beyond the given options, we cannot definitively select an answer based solely on the provided list without any additional context.
