Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine which statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla is correct. The text does not contain any relevant information about the maxillary sinus, maxillary tuberosity, zygomaticomaxillary sutures, or the intermaxillary suture. Therefore, I cannot answer the question using the given data.
