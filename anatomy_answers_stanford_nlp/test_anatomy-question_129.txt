Based on the information provided, there is no relevant data or context that can be used to answer the question about what happens during swallowing. The options provided (A. auditory tube opens, B. cricopharyngeus muscle contracts, C. rima glottis opens, D. gag reflex is suspended) do not relate to the limited context given about an "Enhanced CT scan" or "Enhanced CT scan of carotid vessels." Therefore, I cannot determine the correct answer using only the specified information.
