To determine which muscles are normally active during quiet inspiration using only the information provided, let's analyze the options:

A. External and internal intercostal muscles
B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm
C. Internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm
D. External and internal intercostal muscles and diaphragm

Based on the typical understanding of respiratory physiology, which is likely implied in the information you provided, the external intercostal muscles and the diaphragm are generally known to be active during quiet inspiration. However, since you have requested an answer based only on the specific information given in your context, I will select:

B. External intercostal muscles and diaphragm

This choice is consistent with the common understanding that during quiet (normal, effortless) inspiration, the diaphragm contracts to increase the thoracic volume, and the external intercostal muscles aid in elevating the ribs, contributing to inhalation.

If this matches the information you have, then option B is the correct answer. If not,
