Based on the information provided, there is no specific mention of the anatomical relations of the maxillary sinus, such as its relationship to the floor of the orbit, the upper posterior teeth, the infratemporal fossa, or the hard palate. The text primarily discusses the venous drainage, the positioning relative to other structures, and various other details that are not directly related to the anatomy of the maxillary sinus.

Therefore, using only the information given, I am unable to determine which answer choice (A, B, C, or D) is correct regarding the relationships of the walls of the maxillary sinus.
