Based on the information provided, it is difficult to directly connect the specific details to the clinical presentation of third cranial nerve damage. However, we can attempt to infer possible outcomes from the given statements.

The third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) is generally responsible for controlling most of the eye's movements, eyelid elevation, and pupil constriction. Damage to this nerve typically results in:

- A "down and out" position of the eye because the lateral rectus (innervated by the sixth cranial nerve) and superior oblique (innervated by the fourth cranial nerve) muscles are unopposed.
- Ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) due to loss of levator palpebrae superioris muscle function.
- Pupil dilation (mydriasis) due to loss of parasympathetic innervation to the sphincter pupillae muscle.

Given these typical outcomes of third cranial nerve damage, we can deduce
