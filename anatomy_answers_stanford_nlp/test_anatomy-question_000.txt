Based on the provided information, the lesion causes compression of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen. A lesion at this location would typically result in ipsilateral paralysis of the facial muscles. This is because the facial nerve, as it exits the stylomastoid foramen, primarily innervates the muscles of facial expression. There is no mention in the provided information about effects on taste, lacrimation, or salivation, which are mediated by branches of the facial nerve that would be affected by lesions more proximally.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. paralysis of the facial muscles.
