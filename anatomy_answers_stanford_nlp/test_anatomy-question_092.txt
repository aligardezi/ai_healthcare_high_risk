Based on the information provided, we can determine the likely answer using the relevant clues. The question asks why laryngeal oedema is usually confined to the larynx above the vocal folds. 

The key point to note is:
- The mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues.

This suggests that the structure of the vocal folds, where the mucosa is tightly bound, would make it harder for oedema (swelling due to fluid accumulation) to occur or spread easily in that area. Thus, oedema tends to be confined to areas above the vocal folds where this tight attachment does not exist.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues.
