Based on the information provided, the relevant phrase is "infection occurs within drainage area." Since the question pertains to submandibular lymph nodes being enlarged, we need to consider the drainage area of the submandibular lymph nodes. The provided options are:

A. hard palate.
B. hard palate and upper lip.
C. hard palate, upper lip and upper central incisor.
D. hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor and lower first molar.

Since there is no specific information given in the provided text about which anatomical areas drain to the submandibular lymph nodes, we can only use the general instruction that "infection occurs within drainage area."

Without additional specific information linking the submandibular lymph nodes to a particular drainage area from the options given, we should consider the broadest range of options that might reasonably be within the drainage area for potential infection sites, which would be:

D. hard palate, upper lip, upper central incisor and lower first mol
