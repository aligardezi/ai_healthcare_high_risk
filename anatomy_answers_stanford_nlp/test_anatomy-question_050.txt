Based on the information provided, I can only use the details you've given me to answer the question. However, since no specific information about the palpability of the supraorbital foramen, infraorbital foramen, or mental foramen in a live patient has been provided, I cannot conclusively determine the answer. If you have more specific information about these structures, please share it, and I may be able to help further.
