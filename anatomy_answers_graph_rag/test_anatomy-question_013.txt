In the context of recurrent laryngeal nerve damage, understanding the roles of the cricothyroid muscle and the interarytenoid muscles is crucial. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is responsible for innervating most of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, except for the cricothyroid muscle, which is innervated by the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve [Data: Entities (3731, 437); Relationships (4075, 10113)].

**Cricothyroid Muscle Functionality**

The cricothyroid muscle plays a significant role in adjusting the tension of the vocal cords by lengthening them, which is essential for pitch modulation. Since this muscle is not innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, it remains functional even when the recurrent laryngeal nerve is damaged [Data: Entities (3731, 437); Relationships (4075, 10113)].

**Interarytenoid Muscles and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve**

The interarytenoid muscles, on the other hand, are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Damage to this nerve can lead to weakness or paralysis of these muscles, affecting their ability to adduct the vocal folds fully. This results in the vocal fold on the affected side being positioned in an intermediate state between adduction and abduction [Data: Entities (3190, 2811, 1623); Relationships (4095, 7631)].

**Conclusion**

Given this information, the correct answer is **B. cricothyroid muscle is still functional but the interarytenoids are weak**. This scenario explains why the vocal fold on the injured side is tensed and in an intermediate position, as the cricothyroid muscle can still exert its function, but the interarytenoid muscles cannot fully adduct the vocal fold due to their weakened state.
