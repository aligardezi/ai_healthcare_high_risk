The correct option to complete the statement "The right atrioventricular valveâ€¦" is:

**B. is prevented from everting by papillary muscles.**

### Explanation

The right atrioventricular valve, also known as the tricuspid valve, is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle. It plays a crucial role in ensuring proper blood flow within the heart by preventing the backflow of blood into the right atrium during ventricular contraction. This is achieved through the action of the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae. The papillary muscles contract during ventricular systole, pulling on the chordae tendineae, which are attached to the valve cusps, thereby preventing the cusps from inverting into the atrium [Data: Entities (1472); Relationships (7807, 3891)].

### Why Other Options Are Incorrect

- **A. is a semilunar valve:** This is incorrect because the right atrioventricular valve is not a semilunar valve. Semilunar valves, such as the aortic and pulmonary valves, are located at the exits of the heart's ventricles and have a different structure and function [Data: Entities (1617, 1618)].

- **C. is open during systole:** This is incorrect because the right atrioventricular valve is closed during systole. During this phase, the ventricles contract, and the valve closes to prevent backflow of blood into the atrium [Data: Entities (1472); Relationships (7804)].

- **D. prevents blood returning from the pulmonary trunk as the heart relaxes:** This is incorrect because the tricuspid valve does not prevent blood from returning from the pulmonary trunk. This function is performed by the pulmonary valve, which is a semilunar valve located between the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk [Data: Entities (1618); Relationships (3886, 6325)].
