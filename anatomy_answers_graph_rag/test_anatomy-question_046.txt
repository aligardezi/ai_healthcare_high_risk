The procedure for an X-ray study of the fibula will be performed on the **lower leg**.

### Explanation

The fibula is a bone located in the lower leg, positioned laterally to the tibia. It is the smaller of the two bones in the lower leg and does not participate in the formation of the knee joint or in weight-bearing. The fibula has a proximal head, a narrow neck, and a delicate shaft that ends as the lateral malleolus at the ankle [Data: Entities (1544)]. It is anatomically connected to the tibia and forms part of the ankle joint, creating the socket for the talus [Data: Relationships (5965, 5139)].

### Additional Context

The lower leg is a part of the lower limb that plays a crucial role in movement and support, serving as the limb on which a person or animal walks and stands. It contains muscle compartments that are divided into lateral, anterior, and posterior sections. The muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments are innervated by the common fibular part of the sciatic nerve, highlighting the leg's complex structure and its essential function in locomotion [Data: Entities (831)]. 

In contrast, the heel, toes, and thigh are not directly associated with the fibula. The heel, or calcaneus, is the bone in the foot where the superficial group of muscles in the posterior compartment insert [Data: Entities (2322)]. The toes are the digits of the foot, and the thigh is the region between the hip and the knee [Data: Entities (3160, 284)]. Therefore, the X-ray study of the fibula is specifically focused on the lower leg.
