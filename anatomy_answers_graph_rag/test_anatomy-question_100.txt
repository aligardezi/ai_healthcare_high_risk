### Osteoclasts: Function and Origin

Osteoclasts are specialized cells with a critical role in bone metabolism. They are primarily responsible for the resorption of bone tissue, a process essential for the maintenance, repair, and remodeling of bones. This function is crucial for the regulation of calcium and phosphate levels in the body, as well as for the overall health of the skeletal system.

### Differentiation and Origin

Osteoclasts differentiate from monocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. Monocytes originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. These stem cells give rise to various blood cells, including monocytes, which then migrate to the bone surface where they fuse to form multinucleated osteoclasts. This process is distinct from the differentiation of osteoblasts, which are responsible for bone formation and originate from mesenchymal stem cells.

### Conclusion

Based on the functions and origins of osteoclasts, the correct answer is:

**D. resorb bone and differentiate from monocytes.**

This choice accurately reflects the role of osteoclasts in bone resorption and their differentiation pathway from monocytes.
