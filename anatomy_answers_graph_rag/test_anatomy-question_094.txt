During a right lateral excursion of the mandible, the most active muscle is the **left lateral pterygoid muscle**.

### Explanation

The lateral excursion of the mandible involves the movement of the jaw to the side. In this case, a right lateral excursion means the mandible is moving to the right. This movement is primarily facilitated by the lateral pterygoid muscles, which are responsible for the protraction and side-to-side movement of the mandible.

#### Role of the Lateral Pterygoid Muscles

The lateral pterygoid muscles are crucial in the movement of the mandible. They are located in the infratemporal fossa and are involved in the protraction of the mandible, which is essential for lateral movements. When the mandible moves to the right, the left lateral pterygoid muscle contracts to pull the mandible forward and to the right, while the right lateral pterygoid muscle may relax or contract less intensely to allow this movement [Data: Entities (477, 3618); Relationships (4222, 138, 91)].

#### Coordination with Other Muscles

While the left lateral pterygoid muscle is the most active during a right lateral excursion, other muscles such as the medial pterygoid and masseter also play supportive roles in stabilizing the mandible and assisting in the movement. However, the primary driver of the lateral excursion is the lateral pterygoid muscle on the opposite side of the direction of movement [Data: Entities (480, 896); Relationships (4222, 137, 136)].

In summary, the left lateral pterygoid muscle is the most active during a right lateral excursion of the mandible, making option A the correct choice.
