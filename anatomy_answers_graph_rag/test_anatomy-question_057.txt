The process whereby the stomach muscles contract to propel food through the digestive tract is best described as **C. Peristalsis**.

### Explanation

Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract. This process begins in the esophagus when a bolus of food is swallowed and continues throughout the stomach and intestines. The coordinated contractions and relaxations of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract ensure that food is pushed forward, allowing for digestion and absorption of nutrients [Data: Entities (3805, 2264, 1213)].

### Other Options

- **A. Absorption** refers to the process by which nutrients from digested food are taken up into the bloodstream from the intestines. It is not related to the muscular contractions that move food through the digestive tract.

- **B. Emulsion** is a process that involves mixing two liquids that normally do not mix well, such as oil and water. In the context of digestion, it often refers to the breakdown of fats into smaller droplets, which is facilitated by bile in the small intestine.

- **D. Regurgitation** is the backward flow of food from the stomach to the esophagus, which is the opposite of the forward movement facilitated by peristalsis.

Peristalsis is a critical function of the digestive system, ensuring that food is efficiently processed and nutrients are absorbed as it moves through the gastrointestinal tract.
