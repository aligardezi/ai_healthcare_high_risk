The thoracic cage is a structural unit that is crucial for **D. Respiration**.

### Role in Respiration

The thoracic cage, also known as the rib cage, plays a vital role in the respiratory process. It is composed of the ribs, sternum, and thoracic vertebrae, forming a protective enclosure around the thoracic cavity. This structure supports the lungs and heart, providing a framework that facilitates breathing. During respiration, the thoracic cage expands and contracts, allowing the lungs to inflate and deflate, which is essential for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide [Data: Entities (1658, 412, 399); Relationships (3568, 3702, 3734)].

### Protection of Vital Organs

In addition to its role in respiration, the thoracic cage protects vital organs such as the heart and lungs from physical damage. The ribs and sternum form a sturdy barrier that shields these organs from external impacts, while the flexibility of the rib cage allows for movement and expansion during breathing [Data: Entities (412, 399, 2546); Relationships (3568, 3708)].

### Conclusion

While the thoracic cage is primarily associated with respiration, it also provides structural support and protection for the thoracic organs. It does not play a direct role in alimentation, menstruation, or mentation, which are processes related to digestion, reproductive health, and cognitive function, respectively.
