SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
The muscles derived from the first branchial arch, also known as the mandibular arch, include the muscles of mastication and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B. The muscles of mastication and anterior belly of digastric**

### Explanation

**Muscles of Mastication**: These muscles are responsible for the movement of the jaw and include the masseter, temporalis, medial pterygoid, and lateral pterygoid muscles. They are innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which is associated with the first branchial arch [Data: Entities (4193); Relationships (700, 10290)].

**Anterior Belly of the Digastric Muscle**: This muscle is also derived from the first branchial arch. It is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, similar to the muscles of mastication [Data: Entities (504); Relationships (4230)].

**Posterior Belly of the Digastric Muscle**: This part of the digastric muscle is derived from the second branchial arch and is innervated by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) [Data: Entities (4107); Relationships (3124)].

**Geniohyoid Muscle**: This muscle is not derived from the first branchial arch. It is innervated by a branch of the cervical nerve C1, which is carried along the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII) [Data: Entities (4519); Relationships (6908, 7302)].

In summary, the muscles of mastication and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle are derived from the first branchial arch, making option B the correct choice.
