When a patient experiences damage to their cervical sympathetic chain, it typically results in a condition known as Horner's syndrome. This condition is characterized by a specific set of symptoms due to the loss of sympathetic innervation in the head and neck region.

### Symptoms of Horner's Syndrome

1. **Pupillary Constriction (Miosis):** This occurs due to the paralysis of the dilator pupillae muscle, which is normally innervated by sympathetic fibers. Without this innervation, the sphincter pupillae muscle, which is controlled by parasympathetic fibers, predominates, leading to constriction of the pupil [Data: Entities (1899, 1001); Relationships (6600)].

2. **Partial Ptosis:** This is the drooping of the upper eyelid, caused by paralysis of the superior tarsal muscle, which is also under sympathetic control [Data: Entities (1899); Relationships (4386)].

3. **Absence of Sweating (Anhidrosis):** On the affected side of the face and neck, there is a loss of sympathetic innervation to the sweat glands, leading to an absence of sweating [Data: Entities (1899); Relationships (5582, 2534)].

4. **Vasodilation of Facial Vessels:** The loss of sympathetic tone can lead to vasodilation, which may cause a flushed appearance on the affected side of the face [Data: Sources (1981)].

### Analysis of Options

- **Option A (Pupillary constriction):** This is a correct symptom but does not encompass all the effects of cervical sympathetic chain damage.

- **Option B (Pupillary constriction and vasodilation of facial vessels):** This option includes two correct symptoms but omits the absence of sweating.

- **Option C (Pupillary constriction, vasodilation of facial vessels, and increased facial sweating):** This option incorrectly suggests increased facial sweating, which is contrary to the anhidrosis observed in Horner's syndrome.

- **Option D (Pupillary constriction, vasodilation of facial vessels, increased facial sweating, and decreased lacrimation):** This option is incorrect as it includes increased facial sweating and decreased lacrimation, neither of which are typical symptoms of Horner's syndrome. Decreased lacrimation is not a direct result of sympathetic chain damage but rather involves parasympathetic pathways.

### Conclusion

The most accurate description of the symptoms resulting from damage to the cervical sympathetic chain, consistent with Horner's syndrome, is **Option B: Pupillary constriction and vasodilation of facial vessels**, although it should also include the absence of sweating for completeness.
