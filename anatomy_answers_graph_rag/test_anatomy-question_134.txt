A dental panoramic radiograph, also known as a panoramic X-ray, is a two-dimensional dental X-ray examination that captures the entire mouth in a single image, including the teeth, upper and lower jaws, surrounding structures, and tissues. This type of radiograph is particularly useful for assessing the overall health of the mouth and identifying issues such as impacted teeth, jaw disorders, and sinus problems.

### Structures Visible on a Panoramic Radiograph

1. **Mandibular Canal**: The mandibular canal is a passage within the mandible that carries the inferior alveolar nerve, artery, and vessels. It is closely related to the roots of the lower teeth and is typically visible on a panoramic radiograph as it runs through the mandible [Data: Entities (904); Relationships (6266)].

2. **Maxillary Sinus**: The maxillary sinus is the largest of the paranasal sinuses, located within the maxilla bone. It is closely related to the roots of the upper teeth and is often visible on a panoramic radiograph, especially in the region of the upper jaw [Data: Entities (2487, 2595); Relationships (159, 6267, 752, 8808)].

3. **Hard Palate**: The hard palate forms the bony front part of the roof of the mouth and separates the oral and nasal cavities. While it is not the primary focus of a dental panoramic radiograph, it can sometimes be visible depending on the angle and positioning of the X-ray [Data: Entities (1826)].

4. **Zygomatic Arch**: The zygomatic arch is a bony arch on the side of the skull that forms the prominence of the cheek. It is typically visible on a panoramic radiograph as it is part of the facial skeleton and is located near the maxilla and mandible [Data: Entities (3628); Relationships (6775)].

### Conclusion

Based on the typical visibility of these structures on a dental panoramic radiograph, the correct answer is **D. The mandibular canal, maxillary sinus, hard palate, and zygomatic arch**. All these structures are generally visible on a panoramic X-ray, providing a comprehensive view of the dental and maxillofacial region.
