To determine which statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla is correct, we need to consider the anatomical and developmental aspects of the maxilla and its associated structures.

### Analysis of Statements

**A. Pneumatisation by enlargement of the developing maxillary sinus ceases at puberty**

The maxillary sinus is one of the paranasal sinuses, and its development continues postnatally. Pneumatization, which refers to the process of air space expansion within the bone, typically continues beyond puberty. The maxillary sinus continues to grow and develop into early adulthood, so this statement is not correct [Data: Entities (2487, 2595); Relationships (955, 950)].

**B. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity**

The maxillary tuberosity is a bony prominence at the posterior end of the maxilla. During the growth of the maxilla, space for the eruption of permanent molars is indeed created by the resorption of bone in this area. This process is part of the natural development and adjustment of the maxilla to accommodate the growing teeth. Therefore, this statement is correct [Data: Entities (16); Sources (2397, 2419)].

**C. The zygomaticomaxillary sutures contribute to increase in height and length of the maxilla**

The zygomaticomaxillary suture is a cranial suture between the zygomatic bone and the maxilla. While sutures do play a role in the growth of cranial bones, the primary contributors to the increase in height and length of the maxilla are the growth at the sutures and the alveolar process, not specifically the zygomaticomaxillary suture. Thus, this statement is not entirely accurate [Data: Entities (16); Relationships (164)].

**D. The intermaxillary suture closes about eight years postnatally**

The intermaxillary suture is a line of junction between the two maxillae. It typically remains open for a longer period to allow for growth and development of the maxilla. The closure of this suture generally occurs later in adolescence, not as early as eight years postnatally. Therefore, this statement is incorrect [Data: Entities (5149); Relationships (168)].

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the correct statement about the postnatal growth of the maxilla is:

**B. Space is created for the eruption of the permanent molars by resorption of the maxillary tuberosity.**
