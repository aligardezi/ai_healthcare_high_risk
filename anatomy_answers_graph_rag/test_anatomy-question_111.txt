To determine which foramina pierce the sphenoid bone, we need to examine the anatomical details of each foramen mentioned.

### Foramen Ovale
The foramen ovale is a significant anatomical structure located in the sphenoid bone. It serves as a passageway for several important structures, including the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, the lesser petrosal nerve, emissary veins, and the accessory meningeal artery. It connects the extracranial infratemporal fossa with the middle cranial fossa [Data: Entities (47); Relationships (23, 327, 702, 220, 114)].

### Foramen Rotundum
The foramen rotundum is another opening located in the sphenoid bone. It serves as a passageway for the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, also known as the maxillary nerve. This rounded opening is situated in the middle cranial fossa, allowing the maxillary nerve to exit the skull [Data: Entities (1869); Relationships (7176, 7900, 8530)].

### Foramen Spinosum
The foramen spinosum is a small anatomical opening located in the sphenoid bone. It is known for allowing the passage of the middle meningeal artery into the cranial cavity. Additionally, it transmits the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve [Data: Entities (891); Relationships (3322, 6213)].

### Foramen Lacerum
The foramen lacerum is an irregular, triangular opening located at the base of the skull. It is bordered by the basilar part of the occipital bone, the body of the sphenoid, and the petrous part of the temporal bone. In life, this opening is filled with cartilage and does not serve as a direct passageway for major structures like the other foramina mentioned [Data: Entities (3217); Relationships (3266, 8413, 9546)].

### Conclusion
Based on the anatomical descriptions, the foramina that pierce the sphenoid bone are the foramen ovale, foramen rotundum, and foramen spinosum. The foramen lacerum, while associated with the sphenoid bone, is not primarily a passageway through it in the same manner as the others. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C. The foramen ovale, rotundum and spinosum**
