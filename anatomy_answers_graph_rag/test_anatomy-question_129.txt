During the process of swallowing, several physiological changes occur to ensure the safe passage of food and liquid from the mouth to the esophagus while protecting the airway. Let's examine each of the options provided:

### A. Auditory Tube Opens
The auditory tube, also known as the Eustachian tube, connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. It typically opens during swallowing to equalize the pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. This action helps maintain balance and hearing function, but it is not directly related to the primary mechanisms of swallowing.

### B. Cricopharyngeus Muscle Contracts
The cricopharyngeus muscle, part of the upper esophageal sphincter, actually relaxes during swallowing to allow the passage of food into the esophagus. Its failure to relax can lead to complications such as esophageal rupture [Data: Entities (5357); Sources (2591)].

### C. Rima Glottis Opens
The rima glottidis, the opening between the vocal cords, actually closes during swallowing. This closure is crucial to prevent food and liquid from entering the trachea and lungs, thereby protecting the airway [Data: Entities (1659); Relationships (8197, 4502)].

### D. Gag Reflex is Suspended
The gag reflex is a protective mechanism that is typically suppressed during swallowing to allow the smooth passage of food. This suspension is necessary to prevent the reflexive expulsion of food from the pharynx.

In summary, during swallowing, the auditory tube opens to equalize ear pressure, the cricopharyngeus muscle relaxes (not contracts), the rima glottidis closes to protect the airway, and the gag reflex is temporarily suspended to facilitate the passage of food.
