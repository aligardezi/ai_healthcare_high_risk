SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
Dental plaque is a biofilm that forms on the surfaces of teeth and is composed of bacteria, food particles, and saliva. It is most likely to accumulate in areas that are less accessible during routine oral hygiene practices, such as brushing and flossing. In patients with poor oral hygiene, certain surfaces of the teeth are more prone to plaque accumulation due to their location and the difficulty in cleaning them effectively.

**Buccal Surfaces of the Upper Molars**

The buccal surfaces of the upper molars are one of the common areas where dental plaque tends to accumulate. This is because these surfaces are adjacent to the cheeks and may not be thoroughly cleaned during brushing, especially if the patient does not use proper brushing techniques or neglects to brush the outer surfaces of the teeth. Additionally, the upper molars have a complex anatomy with grooves and pits that can harbor plaque.

**Lingual Surfaces of the Lower Incisors**

The lingual surfaces of the lower incisors are another area where plaque is likely to accumulate. These surfaces face the tongue and are often missed during brushing. The lower incisors are also located near the openings of the salivary glands, which can lead to increased plaque formation due to the constant flow of saliva that contains minerals and proteins that contribute to plaque buildup.

**Conclusion**

Based on the typical patterns of plaque accumulation in individuals with poor oral hygiene, the correct answer is:

**B. The buccal surfaces of the upper molars and lingual surfaces of the lower incisors.**

These areas are prone to plaque buildup due to their anatomical location and the challenges associated with cleaning them effectively. Regular and thorough oral hygiene practices, including proper brushing and flossing techniques, are essential to prevent plaque accumulation and maintain oral health.
