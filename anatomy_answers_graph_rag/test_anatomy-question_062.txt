Damage to the third cranial nerve, also known as the oculomotor nerve, can have several effects on eye function due to its role in controlling most of the eye's movements and pupil constriction. Let's examine each option in the context of oculomotor nerve damage:

### A. Convergent Strabismus
Convergent strabismus, also known as esotropia, is a condition where one or both eyes turn inward. This condition is typically associated with dysfunction of the lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by the abducent nerve (cranial nerve VI), not the oculomotor nerve. Therefore, damage to the oculomotor nerve is not directly associated with convergent strabismus.

### B. Ptosis
Ptosis refers to the drooping of the upper eyelid. The oculomotor nerve innervates the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. Damage to this nerve can lead to ptosis due to the loss of function of this muscle [Data: Entities (4832); Relationships (4362)].

### C. Pupillary Constriction
Pupillary constriction is primarily controlled by the sphincter pupillae muscle, which is innervated by parasympathetic fibers of the oculomotor nerve. Damage to the oculomotor nerve typically results in a dilated pupil (mydriasis) rather than constriction, due to the loss of parasympathetic input [Data: Entities (3419); Relationships (9937)].

### D. Bitemporal Hemianopia
Bitemporal hemianopia is a visual field defect characterized by the loss of vision in the outer (temporal) half of the visual field in both eyes. This condition is typically caused by lesions at the optic chiasm, not by damage to the oculomotor nerve [Data: Entities (4614); Relationships (9281)].

### Conclusion
The most likely effect of damage to the third cranial nerve by trauma to the orbit is **B. ptosis**. This is due to the oculomotor nerve's role in innervating the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which is responsible for lifting the upper eyelid.
