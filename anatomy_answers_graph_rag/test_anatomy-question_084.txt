SUCCESS: Local Search Response:
In the context of an orbital blowout fracture, the most commonly affected wall is the **floor of the orbit**. This type of fracture typically involves the inferior orbital floor, which is one of the most frequent sites of injury in such cases [Data: Entities (3174); Relationships (8813); Sources (1250)].

### Explanation

**Inferior Orbital Floor (B)**: The floor of the orbit is particularly susceptible to blowout fractures due to its relatively thin structure. These fractures often occur when a blunt force is applied to the eye, causing the pressure within the orbit to increase and the floor to give way. This can lead to the entrapment of the inferior oblique muscle and associated tissues, potentially resulting in symptoms such as diplopia (double vision) when looking upwards [Data: Entities (3174); Sources (1250)].

**Medial Wall (D)**: While the medial wall can also be involved in orbital fractures, it is less commonly the primary site of a blowout fracture compared to the floor. Medial wall fractures can result in air entering the orbit from the ethmoidal sinuses, but they are not as frequently the initial point of collapse in a blowout fracture [Data: Entities (3173, 4257); Sources (1250)].

**Roof (A) and Lateral Wall (C)**: These walls are generally thicker and less likely to be the primary sites of a blowout fracture. Fractures in these areas are less common and typically occur in conjunction with more complex facial injuries [Data: Entities (1515, 4258); Sources (1250)].

In summary, the floor of the orbit is the most likely to collapse in a blowout fracture, making option **B. The floor** the correct answer.
