In the context of an extradural hemorrhage, the correct answer is:

**A. skull bones and dura mater.**

### Explanation

An extradural hemorrhage, also known as an epidural hemorrhage, is characterized by bleeding that occurs between the inner surface of the skull and the outer layer of the dura mater. This condition typically arises from the rupture of a meningeal artery, often due to a traumatic injury such as a blow to the head. The accumulation of blood in this space can lead to increased intracranial pressure, which may cause the patient to rapidly deteriorate into a coma if not promptly treated [Data: Entities (555, 1230); Relationships (2520, 3319, 3321, 4566, 4567)].

### Additional Context

The dura mater is the tough, outermost layer of the meninges, which are the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. It is composed of two layers: the outer periosteal layer, which is adherent to the skull, and the inner meningeal layer, which lies against the arachnoid mater. The extradural space is a potential space that can become an actual space filled with blood during vascular trauma, such as the rupture of a meningeal artery [Data: Entities (230, 3400); Sources (2094, 1388)].

In contrast, a subdural hematoma involves bleeding between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, while a subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding in the space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. Neither of these conditions involves bleeding between the skull and the dura mater, which is specific to an extradural hemorrhage [Data: Entities (98, 100); Relationships (1033, 1034)].
