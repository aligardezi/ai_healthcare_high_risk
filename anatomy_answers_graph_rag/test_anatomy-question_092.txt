To understand why laryngeal oedema is usually confined to the larynx above the vocal folds, we need to consider the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the larynx and its components.

### Anatomical Considerations

The larynx is a complex structure located in the neck, playing a crucial role in breathing, sound production, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration [Data: Entities (544)]. It houses the vocal folds, which are essential for sound production and are located within the laryngeal cavity [Data: Entities (1390); Relationships (4509, 7627)].

### Mucosal Attachment

The mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to the underlying tissues. This tight attachment limits the potential space for fluid accumulation, which is a key factor in why oedema is less likely to occur below the vocal folds. The vocal folds, also known as true vocal cords, are involved in sound production and are located within the laryngeal cavity [Data: Entities (1390, 3730); Relationships (4509, 7627)].

### Vascularity and Glandular Presence

The vestibular folds, also known as false vocal cords, are located above the vocal folds and contain numerous mucous glands. These glands contribute to the moisture and lubrication of the laryngeal cavity, which can influence the distribution of oedema. However, the primary reason for oedema being confined above the vocal folds is not the presence of these glands but rather the differences in mucosal attachment and vascularity [Data: Entities (1389, 1388); Relationships (7626)].

### Conclusion

The correct answer is **B. the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues**. This tight attachment restricts the accumulation of fluid below the vocal folds, confining oedema to the area above them. The other options, while related to the anatomy and function of the larynx, do not primarily explain the confinement of oedema to the region above the vocal folds.
